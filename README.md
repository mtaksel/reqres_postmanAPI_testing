Reqres API Postman Collection

This project contains a Postman collection that interacts with the Reqres API, a simple RESTful service providing a wide range of responses for testing purposes. The collection includes various endpoints to demonstrate basic CRUD operations, including user creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion, as well as user registration and login functionalities.
Collection Overview

This Postman collection contains the following requests:

    ListUsers: Retrieves a paginated list of users.
    ListSingleUser: Retrieves the details of a specific user by their ID.
    CreateToken: Authenticates a user and generates a token.
    Create: Creates a new user with specified details.
    UpdatePut: Updates a user's information using the PUT method.
    UpdatePatch: Updates a user's information using the PATCH method.
    Delete: Deletes a user by their ID.
    Register - successful: Registers a user successfully.
    Register - unsuccessful: Attempts to register a user unsuccessfully (e.g., missing fields).

Project Structure

The structure of the collection is organized as follows:

    Requests: Each request is categorized based on the operation it performs (e.g., ListUsers, Create, Update, Delete).
    Test Scripts: Each request includes test scripts to validate the API response. These scripts check for status codes, response time, and the structure of the response data.
    Variables: The collection uses environment variables like authToken and id to store dynamic values such as authentication tokens and user IDs.
